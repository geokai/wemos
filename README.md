1. The fire.py script is from Tony's Desk Tutorials, Adafruit Industries 'learn'
   series, initially as a straight re-type (I need the typing practice).
   fire_cheers.py is my attempt to combine the Cheerlights API implementation with
   this animated light display.
   The animation utilizes 'old skool' methods to create the animated effect by
   creating look-up tables of color sets. These tables are then used to populate
   the display matrix, again using an old-skool method of evaluation of adjacent
   'pixels'.
   By altering the 'HUE' variable the color palette can be created to a
   particular color range.
